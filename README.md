# Math curve drawer


This project uses Python's `turtle` module to draw a 2D coordinate system with labeled axes and connecting lines between corresponding points on the x and y axes.

## Features
- Draws the x and y axes with labeled ticks.
- Draws connecting lines between points on the x-axis and corresponding points on the y-axis in reverse order.
- Allows the user to input the number of points to display.

## How it Works
1. The program first draws the x and y axes.
2. Then it draws ticks along both axes, labeling each tick with a number.
3. Finally, the program connects corresponding points on the x-axis and y-axis using lines. For example, x1 is connected to y10, x2 to y9, and so on.
